# Experience Sampling
## Claims
This app is just for research purpose, so that it's not available for someone who doesn't participant in the research.
But I can show it on my cellphone in interview. 
(or I can provide a link on Google Drive to download apk (Android version) through email)

## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to collect data from users' mental state through psychological questionnaires without internet.
This app will send local notifications to users.
When users receive notifications, they need to do questionnaires right away.

It seems like an easy application, but it's not.
Because one of the requirements is to send notifications exactly at set time, which means we need to overcome the restriction of local notifications.
(e.g. the battery policy of iOS/Android, doze mode of Android, local notification limit counts in iOS ...)

## Use case
### Homepage

They need to set their basic information and preference here.
If you are not a subject in this research, you won't be able to use this app.
(If you really like to test this app, please send me an email (menghueigao@gmail.com). I'll provide a set of subjectID & password just for testing.)
