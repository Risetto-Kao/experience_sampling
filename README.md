# Experience Sampling
## Claims
This app is just for research purpose, so that it's not available for someone who doesn't participant in the research.
But I can show it on my cellphone in interview.

This repository will be complete before 2022/12/02.
Because I need to remove some services to protect the copyright (e.g. the content of questionnaire, UI design) from the psychological team and some core technology of our lab (e.g. mobile sensing of android-specific code).

## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to collect data from users' mental state through psychological questionnaires without internet.
